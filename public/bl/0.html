            I am not going to indent this paragraph and, for the moment at least, I am
            going to resist the urge to change the font, or link to an external one. I am going to forgo
            a stylesheet. There is nothing to load here except for a single index.html document.

            I've spent a lot of time thinking about making a website. Not much time actually making a website,
            but thinking about it. A whole bunch. Many people can probably relate to this feeling. Should I go back to Wordpress, now that I am
            using PHP at work? (spoiler: no.) Should I keep using the static site generator that I've been using
            (Middleman, which is, to its credit, just dandy), or should I switch to a different one? They sure are big, do I really need all that?
            Should I write my own static site generator? Or my own WYSIWYG web editor type wordpressy situation?
            Why the hell would I do that? What would I gain? What do I actually want to publish, and why? Photos? Music? Links? Blog posts? Are they
            really posts or do I want them to be articles? What the hell is the difference? Do I need a database for anything? Do I want a twertter share button? A farcebark like button?
            Should I host everything on my own server, or just set up a tumblr? Should I use a cdn? Should I use analytics?
            I don't need a cdn, not that many people are ever going to come to my site. But what if they do? And what about media files? What then?
            What's the point of all this? What's the point of anything?  Should I change my url? SHOULD I CHANGE MY URL?

            This has been exhausting; I usually end up just watching youtube instead of doing <i>anything at all,</i>
            and that's no good. For all the reasonable questions I could ask myself
            about how and why I should go about making things, I think I could at the very least admit, just for the duration of this post,
            that making <i>some things</i> is better than making <i>no things.</i> Although even right now I am tempted to write a long and rambling essay
            considering whether <i>even that</i> is really the case, or perhaps instead go off somewhere and think about writing that post,
            while watching youtube videos about nothing.  I always want to start at the root of everything, and I always never do, somehow... and so, around and around I go.

            I want to be productive, and I want to make being productive easy and fun and lightweight, but I also want to
            understand all of my tools from the bottom to the top. These two impulses are not friends with each other,
            and this is a central tension that I come back to again and again and again. I let myself be convinced that starting from scratch
            is pointless, or too much work, and I should use whatever is handy, but I can never stop thinking about starting from nothing. I think of this ambivalence
            as one of the defining points of my inner life, and it's actually something I value quite a lot, even though most of the time it turns out to be <i>very</i> unpragmatic.
            Even just this post- I've been sitting on it for over a week.

            So I'm going to try something I've never actually tried before, something I've never had the time or the guts or the whatever to do before:
            I'm going to indulge that whim. I'm going to start from nothing but this, and do as much by hand as possible.
            When I need some kind of functionality, I'll try to make it myself. I'll try to break through that paralysis by wiggling my toes fast enough to move my legs.
